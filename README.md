A Pac-Man style game written in Java

Instead of the yellow guy I will have the face of my dad, and instead of ghosts it will be police vehicles that are chasing him. Instead of pellets my dad will eat bullets. The fruit like cherries and bananas will be pieces of wood, guitars, and paintings.  I don't know yet how I will make the level different than in pac-man since the original game has a very optimal level for the screen space so maybe I'll copy it, or maybe I'll come up with something interesting.  I'm new to Java so I don't know yet.
